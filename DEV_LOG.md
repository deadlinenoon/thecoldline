TASK: Stabilize Upstash KV wrapper and redeploy (replace lib/kv.ts; build; deploy)

Files touched:
- lib/kv.ts (replaced with provided unified KV wrapper)

Verify (separate terminal tab):
- npm run guard  # optional
- npx tsc -noEmit
- npm run build
- npx vercel@latest --prod --force --scope deadlinenoons-projects

Notes:
- The new KV exposes: get, getNum, setNX, del, incr, incrBy, hset, hgetall, lpush, lrange, sadd, smembers, srem, zincrBy, ztop; plus legacy helper exports.
- If any code calls `kv.zincr(...)` from `getKV()`, update to `kv.zincrBy(...)` or rely on helper `kvZIncrBy(...)`.

Change: Fix build by removing legacy avatar Pages API route; add App Router route; scrub Vercel env secret alias.

Details:
- Removed: legacy avatar Pages API handler (build issues).
- Added: app/api/profile/avatar/route.ts with minimal POST handler that echoes JSON.
- vercel.json: removed secret alias usage (env alias); left empty env object.

Next steps (terminal):
- Create a branch and snapshot: `git checkout -b fix-build-and-env && git add -A && git commit -m "snapshot before fix"`.
- Vercel env cleanup/re-add as plain values (no @):
  - `npx vercel env rm ODDS_API_KEY production --yes` (repeat for preview/development)
  - `npx vercel secrets rm odds_api_key --yes` (if exists)
  - `npx vercel env add ODDS_API_KEY production` (repeat for preview/development)

Prompt:
You are Codex at ~/code/thecoldline. Make lib/kv.ts the single permanent KV implementation and re-export the legacy helpers so existing code compiles. All legacy helpers MUST delegate to getKV() so there is one code path. Then build. Print DONE with a short summary.

Files touched:
- lib/kv.ts (replaced with unified KV + memory fallback and legacy helper re-exports)

Notes:
- Added wrappers: kvAvailable, kvGet, kvSetNX, kvDel, kvHSet, kvHGetAll, kvLPush, kvLRange, kvSAdd, kvSMembers, kvSRem, kvIncr, kvIncrBy, kvZIncrBy.
- KV includes methods used across repo: get, getNum, setNX, del, incr, incrBy, hset, hgetall, lpush, lrange, sadd, smembers, srem, zincrBy/zincr (alias), ztop.

Date: 2025-09-14 11:33:39Z

Prompt:
Other user inputs: Defensive Snap Load +0.50,Offensive Snap Load +0.30 is what you show under adjustments however there is no plus sign to see why and there needs to be also not only is the ai bot not pulling injuries etc not pulling miles traveled rz % last 10 vs divisional foe etc

Files touched:
- pages/index.tsx

Changes:
- Added explainability toggles (+/−) for Defensive/Offensive Snap Load, Travel (miles + dock), Red Zone matchup, and MOV Avg in the Adjustments panel, with reasons text showing the exact formula inputs.
- Fixed fallback plays fetch to call `/api/plays` with `home`, `away`, and `kickoff` params (was incorrect `team=`), improving data pulls.

Verify:
- Build and open a matchup. In Adjustments, positive numbers show with a leading `+`. Each of the listed metrics has a `+` button to expand the why-text when non-zero.
- When agent slices are missing, the UI fallbacks now correctly populate plays; miles traveled, RZ %, injuries, and last-10 divisional render when available.
## 2025-09-14 — Fix snap-load autos and weather flags

- Prompt:
  please start by figuring out why this is auto selected on every single game to these when they shouldnt be Other user inputs: Defensive Snap Load +0.50,Offensive Snap Load +0.30 also weather isnt pulling, consensus handle and by bet % isnt pulling miles traveled since last home game and overall isnt pulling last 10 games against divisional opponent if they play one another like bears and lions none of that pulls anymore

- Files touched:
  - `pages/api/agent.ts` — do not coerce missing plays to 0; preserve nulls to avoid auto-setting Defensive/Offensive Snap Load to +0.50/+0.30 when source data is unavailable.
  - `pages/api/weather.ts` — add `wind_deg` to payloads; emit `outOfRange: true` when kickoff is beyond ~8 days so UI shows the correct message.
  - `pages/index.tsx` — show wind direction arrow in game tiles (small) and a larger arrow in the modal Weather panel; ticker weather now includes `wind_deg`.
  - Added goalpost-aware wind viz: mini field with uprights behind the arrow to show direction “toward uprights” contextually.
- Improved Coaching Familiarity detection: team notes now match opponent by full name, mascot (e.g., “Titans”), or abbreviation (e.g., “TEN”), so notes like “Vrabel coached Tennessee 2018–23” correctly trigger auto familiarity for Patriots–Titans.
  - Added explicit “Coach Reunion” tag: when team notes indicate the head coach vs former team, we surface a small badge next to the Coaching Familiarity auto.

- Notes:
  - Root cause for snap-load autos: the agent was outputting `0` for missing plays, which the UI interpreted as extreme low plays → clamped to scale -1 → +0.50/+0.30 autos on every game.
  - Weather: UI checks `outOfRange` to show the horizon note; API now sets it, and includes `wind_deg` expected by UI.

- Verify (terminal tab, not Codex):
  - Load a slate game and click Build; confirm Defensive/Offensive Snap Load no longer default to +0.50/+0.30 when plays are unavailable.
  - Inspect Weather card for games inside 8-day window: temp/wind/precip show; outside window shows the horizon message (not generic "No weather data").
  - Optional: `curl "$BASE/api/agent?home=Chicago%20Bears&away=Green%20Bay%20Packers&kickoff=2025-09-14T17:00:00Z" | jq .plays` and confirm nulls for unknown plays, not zeros.
  - On the games list, each tile should show a small blue wind arrow with mph when available.
  - Open the modal and confirm a larger wind arrow with mph is shown in the Weather panel.

Date: 2025-09-14 11:45:17Z

Prompt:
Whatever happened to the context supposed to go to the right... add 1000 simulations button; consensus bars; weather inclement test for Seahawks; start now.

Files touched:
- pages/index.tsx

Changes:
- Open the right-side "Game context" panel by default when the Cold Line modal opens (ensures simulations and context are immediately visible).
- Added a temporary DEV override: if a matchup involves the Seattle Seahawks, force inclement weather values (31°F, 25 mph wind, 70% precip) and set ticker weather so the 🚨 siren appears. This is for QA only and can be removed on request.
- Consensus, weather, and stats bars were not removed; confirmed they render when data present. Fallbacks still derive consensus from market when scrape missing.

Verify:
- Click "Build Cold Line" → modal opens with two-column layout; right panel shows Game context and Simulations buttons (1k/5k/10k).
- Select a Seahawks game → weather panel shows snow/wind with 🚨 and flashing siren in the ticker.
## 2025-09-14 — Modernize Build Cold Line page

- Prompt: “i meant build cold line page” (modernize the standalone page)
- Files touched:
  - `pages/coldline.tsx` — refreshed layout and styling, added header, matchup header with logos, normalized verdict thresholds to match the main app, improved responsive grids, and added a clear “Propagate to Hot” CTA.
  - Removed the decorative close (×) overlay button from the page header to avoid an extra control near the logo.
- Verify:
  - Open `/coldline` in the app.
  - Select a game from the dropdown; the matchup header shows team logos and kickoff.
  - Enter a Cold Line value; click “Propagate to Hot” to reveal Hot Line and Cold−Hot delta.
## 2025-09-14 — Next/Tailwind config cleanups

- Prompt: Fix invalid Webpack config, keep safe CSS minify toggle, quiet Tailwind safelist warnings.
- Files touched:
  - `next.config.js` — replaced with minimal valid config; removed custom `_tclPatched`; kept `experimental.optimizeCss=false`; preserved `NO_CSS_MINIFY=1` toggle via `webpack` hook; retained `images.remotePatterns` for openweathermap icons.
  - `tailwind.config.js` — reduced `safelist` to just `backdrop-blur` pattern to silence warnings.
- Verify (separate terminal):
  - Lint/types only if desired; do not build per protocol.
  - Ensure `/pages/coldline.tsx` next/image remote icon still loads (config keeps remotePatterns).
## 2025-09-14 — Config hardening per ops script

- Applied minimal `next.config.js` with only supported keys and a safe `NO_CSS_MINIFY` toggle. Removed any custom keys.
- Tightened `tailwind.config.js` safelist to only `backdrop-blur` pattern to quiet warnings.
- Verified `styles/globals.css` starts with Tailwind layers.
## 2025-09-14 — Improve wind affordance in game tiles

- Prompt:
  apply a way for the user to know that the wind inside the boxes you can select inside landing page when logged inn so you know they are clickable and can view the direction

- Files touched:
  - pages/index.tsx

- Summary of changes:
  - Enhanced the weather/wind chip in the game selection tiles to look and behave like a clickable control.
  - Added hover styles, border, and background to the chip; added an inline label that toggles between “View” and “Hide”.
  - Kept the small wind arrow preview and mph/deg text; added underline hover to the text for additional affordance.
  - Improved accessibility: added `role="button"`, `tabIndex`, `aria-expanded`, and keyboard support for Enter/Space.

- How to test/verify:
  1) Log in and go to the landing page with the game grid.
  2) In any game tile, hover over the weather chip at the top-right; it should show a subtle cyan border and darker background, with a “View” label.
  3) If wind data is available, a small arrow and “mph @ deg°” appear. Clicking the chip should expand an inline wide wind field visualization; the label switches to “Hide”.
  4) Click again (or press Enter/Space when the chip is focused) to collapse the visualization.
  5) Ensure card click still selects the game; clicking the wind chip only toggles the wind visualization without changing selection.
## 2025-09-14 — Remove Seattle test alert; improve wind arrow legibility

- Prompt:
  remove the alert in seattle game i confirmed it does work. inside the build cold line button when u show the wind would it make more sense to use an arrow that is more legible?

- Files touched:
  - pages/index.tsx

- Summary of changes:
  - Removed Seattle-specific DEV TEST overrides that forced inclement weather and the alert icon in game tiles. Now alerts only show when real data is inclement.
  - In the Build Cold Line weather section, replaced the compact WindFieldArrow with the wider WindFieldWide visualization for better legibility.

- How to test/verify:
  1) On the game list, any Seattle Seahawks matchup should no longer always show the 🚨 alert; it should only appear when actual weather qualifies as inclement.
  2) Click “Build Cold Line” and observe the Weather block: the wind now renders using the wide field arrow, which is larger and easier to read.
## 2025-09-14 — Temperature in tiles + expandable weather details

- Prompt:
  the temperature should show in the boxes on user login landing page. user should be able to click it and it expand weather info

- Files touched:
  - pages/index.tsx

- Summary of changes:
  - Added temperature display to the game tile weather chip (e.g., “72°F”).
  - Clicking the chip expands an inline weather panel showing Temp, Wind (mph @ deg), Precip probability, and Conditions; still shows the wide wind arrow when wind data exists.
  - Fetched and stored `description` from `/api/weather` in the compact ticker weather state so the expanded panel can show conditions.
  - Kept a11y affordances: `role=button`, `tabIndex`, `aria-expanded`, keyboard toggle.

- How to test/verify:
  1) Log in and view the landing page game grid.
  2) Each tile’s weather chip shows an icon and the temperature when available.
  3) Click the chip → an inline panel expands with Temp/Wind/Precip/Cond; if wind data exists, a wide field arrow appears beneath the summary.
  4) Click again (or Enter/Space) to collapse; card selection remains unchanged.
## 2025-09-14 — Odds highlights + consensus in Build Cold Line

- Prompt:
  under odds your supposed to highlight the best line in green and worst line in red and than youre still not showing consensus on the page when you press build cold line

- Files touched:
  - pages/index.tsx

- Summary of changes:
  - Spreads by sportsbook already highlighted best (green) and worst (red). Kept and verified.
  - Added Moneyline by sportsbook section with per-book away/home prices; highlights best price in green and worst in red for each side.
  - Ensured consensus loads when opening Build Cold Line by triggering a consensus fetch for the active matchup in the button onClick in addition to agent/slate fetch. Fallback still derives from market implied if scraping fails.

- How to test/verify:
  1) Select a game and open the detail (or Build Cold Line modal): under odds, see per-book Spreads and now Moneyline rows.
  2) In each list, verify the numerically best value is highlighted green and the worst red.
  3) Click “Build Cold Line” — consensus bars (Bets, and Handle if available) render shortly after opening, using scraped or derived values.
## 2025-09-14 — User profile photo (avatar)

- Prompt:
  allow users to change the profile photo to their own where it says you in  a circle

- Files touched:
  - legacy avatar API handler migrated to App Router
  - components/Header.tsx
  - pages/account.tsx

- Summary of changes:
  - Added API endpoint `GET/POST /api/profile/avatar`:
    - POST accepts `{ dataUrl }` (base64 image: png/jpeg/webp), stores in KV as `avatar:{email}`; falls back to `/tmp/data/avatars/*.txt` when KV not configured.
    - GET streams the image bytes for the logged-in user with correct Content-Type or returns 204 if none.
  - Header now renders the user’s avatar if available (`/api/profile/avatar`), otherwise falls back to the “You” placeholder.
  - Account page includes a Profile photo section with file picker, preview, and a separate Save button. Client side resizes/crops to a 256×256 square; user clicks Save to persist.
  - Kept accessibility and simple feedback messages.

- How to test/verify:
  1) Log in; visit `/account`. In Profile photo card, upload a png/jpg/webp.
  2) On success, preview updates. Navigate anywhere; header circle now shows your photo.
  3) Refresh — the header fetches `/api/profile/avatar` and still shows the photo. If no avatar, it shows “You”.
## 2025-09-14 — Add more markets display (moneyline and totals by book)

- Prompt:
  add more betting markets that the api we pay for uses you have plenty of room like i said you can always draw lines if you need to put them closer together

- Files touched:
  - pages/index.tsx

- Summary of changes:
  - Added Moneyline by sportsbook table (per-book away/home prices) with best (green) / worst (red) highlights per side.
  - Added Totals by sportsbook table (per-book O/U points). Highlights the lowest total in green (best for Over) and highest in red (worst for Over) and includes a note clarifying Over/Under orientation.
  - Kept existing Spreads by sportsbook highlights.

- How to test/verify:
  1) Select a game and scroll to the Odds section.
  2) Verify three blocks exist: Spreads, Moneyline, Totals — each with per-book rows.
  3) Check highlights: spreads/min/max, moneyline best/worst per side, totals lowest/highest noted with Over/Under guidance.
## 2025-09-14 — Compact weather chip in game tiles

- Prompt:
  please fix this its sloppy the boxes were perfect size before if view is too much add a plus sign if u can keep view and it looks good than great

- Files touched:
  - pages/index.tsx

- Summary of changes:
  - Replaced the "View/Hide" text on the weather chip with compact "+/−" to reduce width.
  - Removed inline "mph @ deg°" text from the chip; kept icon, temp, and a small arrow only. Full details still appear in the expanded panel.
  - Added `whitespace-nowrap` to the chip to prevent wrapping.
  - Made the scroll area vertical-only (`overflow-y-auto overflow-x-hidden`) to eliminate the horizontal scrollbar.

- How to test/verify:
  1) Open the landing page game grid; tiles should retain their previous compact size without horizontal scrollbar.
  2) Weather chip shows icon + temp + small arrow + plus sign. Clicking toggles expansion; the sign flips to minus in expanded state.
  3) Expanded panel still shows full weather summary and wide wind arrow.
## 2025-09-14 — Short date/time in game tiles

- Prompt:
  feel free instead of using for example september for use 9/14 1pm for todays 1pm kickoffs if that is why you couldnt fit the view button for weather inside the box

- Files touched:
  - pages/index.tsx

- Summary of changes:
  - Added `formatETShort` that renders ET as `M/D h[ :mm]am/pm` without year (e.g., `9/14 1pm`).
  - Game tiles now use the short formatter, reducing width and keeping the row on a single line.
  - This is limited to tile headers; other areas continue using the fuller `formatET`.

- How to test/verify:
  1) Open the game grid; the top line of each tile shows `M/D h[ :mm]am/pm` (no year, no timezone suffix), e.g., `9/14 1pm`.
  2) Weather chip remains compact with `+`/`−` toggle and no overflow.
## 2025-09-14 — Fix header logo (missing asset)

- Prompt:
  fix the logo right now it shows a ? where logo is supposed to be.

- Files touched:
  - components/Header.tsx

- Summary of changes:
  - Header previously referenced `/logo-coldline.svg`, which does not exist in `public/`.
  - Switched to `/logo-ice-script.svg` (present) and added an `onError` fallback to `/logo-coldline-home.svg` to avoid broken logo icons.

- How to test/verify:
  1) Load any page with the top header — logo should render.
  2) Temporarily rename `public/logo-ice-script.svg` locally to simulate a failure; header should fall back to `logo-coldline-home.svg` instead of showing a broken image.
## 2025-09-14 — Weather visuals: realistic goalposts + NESW; stadium + primetime markers

- Prompt:
  make the goal posts under weather look more realistic and place N E S W for North East South and West on each field. list stadium name under each game as well and if a game is being played on primetime place a tv emoji with a spotlight emoji pointing towards it

- Files touched:
  - pages/index.tsx

- Summary of changes:
  - Enhanced `WindGoalpost` and `WindFieldWide` SVGs:
    - Added hash/yard lines, thicker bases, and NESW edge labels.
    - Kept wind arrow with speed context; visuals are clearer but compact.
  - Stadium names: tiles now show the home stadium name under the kickoff time; the main game header shows it too.
  - Primetime marker: for Sun/Mon/Thu 7pm+ ET, show 📺🔦 next to the stadium line.

- How to test/verify:
  1) Open a game tile; under the date line, see the stadium name (truncate if long). If primetime, a 📺🔦 appears.
  2) Expand weather or view full weather panel; goalpost fields show NESW and more realistic uprights.
  3) Active game header (above odds/weather) also shows the stadium name with primetime marker when applicable.
## 2025-09-14 — Analytics overview freshness + refresh

- Prompt:
  analytics overviewe doesnt appear to be working anymore i have been using it and its still to change in hours

- Files touched:
  - pages/api/analytics/summary.ts
  - pages/admin/analytics.tsx

- Summary of changes:
  - API now sets `Cache-Control: no-store` to avoid CDN/browser caching of analytics responses.
  - Admin UI fetches with `cache:'no-store'`, appends a timestamp query param, and adds a Refresh button.
  - Auto-refresh every 60 seconds while the page is open.

- How to test/verify:
  1) Generate events by using the app for a bit (pageviews/actions) — analytics writer pushes to KV/file.
  2) Open `/admin/analytics`; values should update within a minute; click Refresh to force.
  3) Confirm network responses show `Cache-Control: no-store` and no stale data is served.
## 2025-09-14 — Users list fallback + managed invites

- Prompt:
  on the backend the users button still doesnt show anyone when i can see 4 users have registed under the analytics overview. also create a box under invite code so i can have multiple and track them

- Files touched:
  - pages/api/auth/users.ts
  - lib/invites.ts (new)
  - pages/api/auth/invites.ts (new)
  - pages/api/auth/signup.ts
  - pages/admin/index.tsx (InviteCard)

- Summary of changes:
  - Users endpoint: if the persistent user store returns empty, derive a fallback list from analytics events (unique `uid` emails from `analytics:events`). This lets you see signups even if KV/file persistence is unavailable on the current instance.
  - Managed invites: Added KV-backed invites you can add/remove and track uses.
    - New API `GET/POST/DELETE /api/auth/invites` for listing/adding/removing codes.
    - Signup now accepts any managed code in addition to the ENV `INVITE_CODE` or whitelist, and increments a per-code usage counter.
    - Admin dashboard Invite card now includes a “Managed invites” box with add/remove and shows `(uses)` per code.

- How to test/verify:
  1) Admin → Users: should list known users; if store empty, it falls back to emails seen in analytics events.
  2) Admin → Invite users: Add a managed invite. Use it on /signup and create an account. The invite’s “uses” count increases and is visible in the list.
## 2025-09-14 — Fill top-card space + surface simulations

- Prompt:
  please make better use of all that empty space. i still dont see any simulation button you say exists

- Files touched:
  - pages/index.tsx

- Summary of changes:
  - Active metrics card now includes a compact snapshot of the active game (teams, spread, total, moneyline).
  - Added quick simulation buttons (1k/5k/10k) directly under the Build Cold Line button so they’re visible without expanding any panel. Clicking runs the sim and opens the Game context panel where results are shown.

- How to test/verify:
  1) On the landing page top row, the middle card shows a small market snapshot for the selected game.
  2) In the right card, click 1k/5k/10k to run simulations; see results appear in the “Game context” box below.
## 2025-09-14 — Cowboys bar color set to silver

- Prompt:
  use silver for dallas cowboys bar graph color

- Files touched:
  - pages/index.tsx

- Summary of changes:
  - Updated `TEAM_COLORS` for `Dallas Cowboys` to use silver `#A5ACAF` so consensus and other bars render in silver instead of navy.

- pages/api/travel/data.ts (serve persisted data)
- components/TravelMilesBarChart.tsx (YTD bar chart from API)
- components/NextWeekTravelTable.tsx (upcoming week travel table)
- pages/travel.tsx (Travel UI page)
- tests/travelCompute.test.ts (minimal test skeleton)
- vercel.json (add cron for /api/travel/run Tue 12:01am ET)

Test/verify instructions:
- In a separate terminal tab (per protocol), run:
  - npm run guard
  - npx tsc -noEmit
  - Set UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL and UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN in env.
  - Optionally seed more realistic data into data/*.json.
  - Start dev server and open /travel to view the chart and table.
  - Manually hit /api/travel/run to populate Redis, then /api/travel/data?kind=ytd and ?kind=next_week to verify.
  - Deploy; the new cron at Tue 12:01am ET will call /api/travel/run.

Prompt:
You are Codex at the project root of thecoldline. Fix the build-blocking API type mismatch by (1) removing direct module imports of pages/api/** and replacing them with HTTP fetch calls, and (2) widening the internal ApiRouteConfig type + invoker to support both NextApiHandler (req,res) and Route-Handler (req)=>Response. Do NOT run builds. Idempotent. Print DONE when finished.

Files touched:
- lib/oddsTypes.ts (new)
- pages/oddsboard.tsx
- pages/weather.tsx
- pages/login.tsx

Changes:
- Removed type-only imports from `pages/api/odds` in three pages and introduced a shared `lib/oddsTypes.ts` exporting the `Event` type. This avoids any direct module imports from `pages/api/**` in app code.
- No call sites in the repo were found importing executable code from `pages/api/**`; therefore, no replacements with `fetch()` were necessary.
- No internal API registry or `ApiRouteConfig` invoker exists in this codebase; Phase B was not applicable.
- `tsconfig.json` already includes `"lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "esnext"]`.

Verify (separate terminal tab, per protocol):
- Type-check only: `npx tsc -noEmit`
- Grep to confirm no imports from `pages/api/**` remain in non-API code:
  rg -n "from '(\.\.?/)?pages/api/|from \"(\.\.?/)?pages/api/"
- Run the app and ensure Odds/Weather/Login pages render and fetch from `/api/odds` as before.

Prompt:
on the backend where codes are created or people to sign up can you please give the new link associated with the code for easy copy paste invite right out of the backend. also the user that joins using the link should be brought to the signup page and the promo code already filled inn if they are using the link

Files touched:
- pages/api/auth/invites.ts
- pages/admin/index.tsx
- pages/signup.tsx

Changes:
- Backend: when creating a managed invite (POST /api/auth/invites), the response now includes `code` and `link` (absolute URL to `/signup?code=...`) for easy copy/paste.
- Admin UI: shows a "New invite link" copy field after adding a code, and adds a "Copy link" action per managed invite that copies `${origin}/signup?code=...`.
- Signup page: auto-fills the invite code from URL query supporting `code`, `invite`, or `promo` param names.

Verify:
- Admin → Invite users → add a managed invite; a copyable link appears. For existing entries, click "Copy link" and share it.
- Open the copied link in a browser; it routes to `/signup` with the invite field pre-filled.

Prompt:
You are Codex at the project root of thecoldline. Fix the build errors by installing and wiring the missing dependencies. Do NOT run builds. Idempotent. Print DONE when finished.

Files touched:
- lib/store.ts

Changes:
- Ensured `@upstash/redis` usage exports the Redis client: `export const redis = new Redis({ url: process.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL!, token: process.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN! })`. No business logic altered.
- package.json already included `luxon`, `geographiclib`, and `@upstash/redis` (newer compatible versions). No changes needed to versions per instruction (“add if not present”).
- Lockfile update should be performed via `npm install` in a separate terminal tab as needed.

Verify (terminal tab, not Codex):
- Run `npm install` to sync `package-lock.json` with current dependencies.
- Run `npx tsc -noEmit` to confirm types pass and imports resolve.

Prompt:
yes thats what i asked you to do is to keep the tv put remove the spotlight replace with the logo of that day

Files touched:
- pages/login.tsx
- public/primetime/mnf.svg (new)
- public/primetime/snf.svg (new)
- public/primetime/tnf.svg (new)

Changes:
- Replaced the secondary “spotlight” idea with actual day-specific primetime logos next to the TV icon in the login rotating widget. For Monday/Sunday/Thursday primetime, we now show 📺 + an inline SVG badge (MNF/SNF/TNF).
- Added minimal SVG logo badges under `public/primetime/`.

Verify:
- Open the login page; for any Mon/Sun/Thu 8–9pm ET kickoff, you should see a TV icon followed by the appropriate MNF/SNF/TNF badge. No flashlight/spotlight appears.

Prompt:
[image] please fix the wind exposure and real feel temp. wind is something that effects both teams but otherwise tampa is a warm weather team so hot weather isnt going to effect them not to mention the game is being played in a dome and i told you that if a team plays in a dome to replace the weather emoji altogether with a domed stadium emoji. this would also display a much larger domed stadium emoji in the weather section and in there stating stadium has retractable roof (expected to be closed) if it is indeed. if its retractaable and expected to be open than it should display temperature otherwise temperature under the weather tab should show the set tempertature indoor domes and stadiums climate control set at

Files touched:
- pages/api/weather.ts
- pages/login.tsx
- pages/weather.tsx

Changes:
- Weather API now annotates stadium roof and indoor expectations using lib/stadiums + team abbr mapping. For domes or retractables expected closed, wind and precip are zeroed and temp is set to a climate-control setpoint (70°F). Payload includes `roof`, `expectedClosed`, and `indoor` flags.
- Login primetime/weather chip now uses the API’s `roof`/`expectedClosed` to render a dome emoji when indoors (in addition to existing dome-team fallback).
- Weather page shows a larger dome emoji and an explanatory label when indoors; hides wind/precip under indoor conditions.

Verify (terminal tab):
- Hit `/api/weather?home=Houston%20Texans&kickoff=<ISO>` when forecast is extreme/temp/wind/precip ⇒ response shows `expectedClosed: true`, `wind_mph:0`, `temp_f:70`, and description notes retractable expected closed.
- Open `/weather` page and confirm dome icon and indoor label appear for indoor games; otherwise wind arrow and outdoor details show.
